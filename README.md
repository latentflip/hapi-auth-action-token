# hapi-action-token-auth

Often in web applications you need to be able to generate secure, unguessable, expirable urls for specific actions.

For example:

* signup invitations
* signup confirmations
* password resets
* accepting friend requests

We can use JWTs for these, as they are stateless, and expirable

```js
```
